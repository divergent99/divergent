<b><h2>About Me</h2></b>

My Personal Repository

<b>Interests</b> : 
1. Machine Learning / Deep Learning: CNN,RNNs, NLP, SVM Regression, Decision Trees / Random Forest, Logistic Regression

3. Platforms: Anaconda, RStudio, Android Studio, VScode, Colab

<b>Projects</b> : 

<b>1. TRAFFIC DIVERSION SYSTEM - OBJECT RECOGNITION USING CNN 2019</b>
‚Ä¢ Deployed CNN to detect incoming vehicles on a busy intersection to prioritize the flow of traffic to avoid congestion.
‚Ä¢ The High - Speed camera will capture the live feed of the incoming traffic which will be processed further to determine the number of
vehicles in a lane.

<b>2. AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE GESTURE ANALYSIS USING TENSORFLOW BACK-END AND OPENCV 2020</b>
‚Ä¢ Implemented a customer-based utility service for specially-abled people (deaf and mute specifically)
‚Ä¢ Motive : Deaf and mute people use sign language for communication and thus face a lot of problems in day ‚Äìto‚Äì day activities like
ordering food at a ‚ÄúDrive ‚Äì thru ‚Äù or having a conversation with an attendant who is oblivious to their predicament.
‚Ä¢ ASL Detection is based on Image Processing and Object Detection integrated with a Computer webcam or any other video detecting
accoutrements in order to help both; the customer and the retailer to have a better engagement whilst having a conversation. 

<b>3. FRESH - AN ANDROID BASED RESTAURANT FOOD ORDERING APP 2020</b>
‚Ä¢ Developed an android application that scans QR codes and displays the menu of a particular restaurant allowing the user to order and pay
via the application per se.
‚Ä¢ Me and my team wanted to impart a millennial experience to the customers by combining technology with a decent restaurant experience.
