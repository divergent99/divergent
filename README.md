# About Me
My Personal Repository

Interests :

3. Platforms: Anaconda, RStudio, Android Studio, VScode

Projects : 

1. TRAFFIC DIVERSION SYSTEM - OBJECT RECOGNITION USING CNN 2019
• Deployed CNN to detect incoming vehicles on a busy intersection to prioritize the flow of traffic to avoid congestion.
• The High - Speed camera will capture the live feed of the incoming traffic which will be processed further to determine the number of
vehicles in a lane.

2. AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE GESTURE ANALYSIS USING TENSORFLOW BACK-END AND OPENCV 2020
• Implemented a customer-based utility service for specially-abled people (deaf and mute specifically)
• Motive : Deaf and mute people use sign language for communication and thus face a lot of problems in day –to– day activities like
ordering food at a “Drive – thru ” or having a conversation with an attendant who is oblivious to their predicament.
• ASL Detection is based on Image Processing and Object Detection integrated with a Computer webcam or any other video detecting
accoutrements in order to help both; the customer and the retailer to have a better engagement whilst having a conversation. 

3. FRESH - AN ANDROID BASED RESTAURANT ORDERING APP 2020
• Developed an android application that scans QR codes and displays the menu of a particular restaurant allowing the user to order and pay
via the application per se.
• Me and my team wanted to impart a millennial experience to the customers by combining technology with a decent restaurant experience.
